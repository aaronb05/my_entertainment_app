Just a fun application I built to practice consuming API's in a .NET Core environment as well as working on dependency injection.

View movies that are playing now, full details of those movie, as well as related movies by genre id.

Will be able to view TV shows as well but still working on that funtionality.

Next up will be finishing up the TV shows, adding some pagination to view even more movies and TV shows!

Future updates will include adding a search function and some styling updates
